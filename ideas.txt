WHAT I WISH I HAD BEEN TOLD IN CSI:
Take time in the beginning to set yourself up by:
    -make sure you understand the prompt
    -pseudocode what you're trying to do
    -download linters (if applicable)
    -set up source control FOR EVERY PROJECT
    -commit to GitHub often with small, successes and detailed commit messages

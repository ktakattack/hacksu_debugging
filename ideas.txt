WHAT I WISH I HAD BEEN TOLD IN CSI:
Take time in the beginning to set yourself up by:
    -make sure you understand the prompt
    -pseudocode what you're trying to do
    -download linters (if applicable)
    -set up source control FOR EVERY PROJECT
    -commit to GitHub often with small, successes and detailed commit messages


-Google, StackOverflow, C++ Reference, GeeksforGeeks.com, W3, LinkedIn Learning, YouTube, Code Academy, Khan
-print statements
-break points
-draw it out
-write out code w/ a pencil
-talk out loud (rubber duck debugging)
-reading line-by-line
-trash it and start over
-people :)
-tutoring
-step-away for a short break
-semi-colons
-error message 
-understanding the bigger picture of code fundamentals
